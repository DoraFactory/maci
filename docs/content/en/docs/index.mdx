# MACI Documentation

MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) is a cryptography-based on-chain voting system that provides privacy protection and anti-collusion capabilities through zero-knowledge proofs.

## Quick Navigation

**New to MACI?** Read [What is MACI](/docs/introduction/what-is-maci) to understand core concepts, then follow the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/introduction/quick-start) to create your first vote.

**Need to integrate into your app?** Check out [SDK Installation](/docs/sdk/installation) and [Complete Examples](/docs/examples/basic-voting).

**Want to understand technical details?** Start with [Protocol Overview](/docs/protocol/overview) to learn how MACI works.

## Learning by Role

### Application Developers

You want to integrate MACI voting functionality into your application:

1. [What is MACI](/docs/introduction/what-is-maci) - Understand basic concepts
2. [Quick Start](/docs/introduction/quick-start) - Run your first example in five minutes
3. [SDK Installation](/docs/sdk/installation) - Configure development environment
4. [Create Round](/docs/sdk/create-round) - Learn to create voting rounds
5. [Voting Guide](/docs/sdk/voting-guide) - Implement user voting flow

### Protocol Researchers

You want to understand MACI's cryptographic mechanisms and design philosophy:

1. [Protocol Overview](/docs/protocol/overview) - Overall architecture
2. [Core Concepts](/docs/protocol/core-concepts) - Key components and data structures
3. [Cryptography](/docs/protocol/cryptography) - EdDSA, Poseidon, ZK proofs
4. [Privacy Protection](/docs/protocol/privacy-protection) - Identity anonymization and anti-collusion design
5. [Message Flow](/docs/protocol/message-flow) - Lifecycle of voting messages

### Contract Developers

You want to understand MACI contract implementation or perform secondary development:

1. [Architecture](/docs/contracts/architecture) - Contract system architecture
2. [Registry Contract](/docs/contracts/registry) - Operator and round management
3. [AMACI Contract](/docs/contracts/amaci) - Anonymous voting implementation
4. [Workflow](/docs/contracts/workflow) - Complete voting lifecycle

### Operators

You want to run a MACI Operator node:

1. [Protocol Overview](/docs/protocol/overview) - Understand operator responsibilities
2. [Message Flow](/docs/protocol/message-flow) - Learn message processing
3. [Workflow](/docs/contracts/workflow) - Understand processing timing and requirements

## Core Components

### Smart Contracts

- **Registry** - Manages operator registration and voting round creation
- **AMACI** - Anonymous voting contract instance, handles user registration and voting

### SDK and Tools

- **@dorafactory/maci-sdk** - TypeScript client SDK
- **@dorafactory/maci-operator** - Operator system
- **maci-crypto** - Rust cryptography library

### Zero-Knowledge Circuits

ZK circuits implemented using Circom, supporting Groth16 and PLONK proof systems.

## Use Cases

- **DAO Governance** - Community proposals and protocol parameter voting
- **Quadratic Funding** - Gitcoin Grants-style public goods funding
- **Organization Elections** - Internal elections and representative selection
