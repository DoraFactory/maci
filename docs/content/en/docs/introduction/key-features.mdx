# Key Features

Main features and advantages of AMACI.

## Identity Anonymization

AMACI's most important innovation. Using the add-new-key mechanism, even the operator cannot determine voter identity.

Create a new identity through zero-knowledge proofs, breaking the link with the original wallet address. The operator only knows "someone voted" but doesn't know who specifically, preventing targeted bribery or retaliation.

Provides three registration methods: signup (fast but not anonymous), add-new-key (fully anonymous but requires waiting), pre-add-new-key (anonymous and instant). Choose based on privacy needs.

## Vote Content Encryption

All voting messages are encrypted with the operator's public key before being submitted on-chain. Blockchain observers can only see encrypted data and cannot know who voted for what.

Uses ECDH + Poseidon encryption. Only the operator can decrypt message content, but the operator is constrained by zero-knowledge proofs and must correctly process all votes.

## Anti-Bribery Mechanism

Key change functionality prevents voters from proving their final vote to third parties.

Even if accepting a bribe and voting with the old key, you can still secretly change keys and revote. Only the new vote counts; bribers cannot verify. Combined with add-new-key, bribers can't even find bribery targets.

## Revotable

Voters can vote multiple times; the last vote counts.

Prevents forced voting: after being forced to vote for a certain option, you can secretly revote. Also allows changing your mind or correcting mistakes. Through nonce mechanism, ensures sequential processing with old votes being overwritten.

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification

After processing votes, operators must generate ZK proofs proving correct processing of all votes.

Proofs ensure: processed all messages, did not tamper with votes, correctly updated state tree, correctly tallied results. Anyone can verify the proof to confirm correct results. Contracts automatically verify proofs; verification failure results in rejection.

## Multiple Voting Modes

Supports different voting rules:

**One Person One Vote (1P1V)** - Voice credits directly count as votes. Suitable for simple democratic voting.

**Quadratic Voting (QV)** - Square of votes is the consumption amount. Encourages distributed voting, prevents whale monopoly. Suitable for public goods funding, priority ranking, etc.

## Flexible Whitelists

Multiple ways to restrict voting participants:

**Address List** - Specify specific addresses; only addresses on the list can signup. Suitable for known user groups.

**Token Holders** - Based on on-chain token holdings. Can set minimum thresholds and weight calculation rules. Suitable for token-weighted voting.

**Snapshot Height** - Uses token balance at a specific block height, preventing temporary token purchases for voting followed by selling.

## Professional Operator Network

Permissioned professional nodes provide services; users don't need to run operator software themselves.

Operators handle message processing, proof generation, and result submission. Select operator and pay service fee when creating rounds. Operator network managed by Dora Factory, ensuring service quality.

## Gas Station Support

Automatically subsidizes user transaction fees.

Users can participate in voting without holding native tokens. Configure gas station when creating rounds; contracts automatically subsidize gas for whitelisted users. Lowers participation barriers, improves user experience.

## Cross-Chain Support

Supports tokens and data from Cosmos ecosystem chains.

Can set whitelists based on token holdings from chains like Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, etc. Supports cross-chain voting and governance. Connects multiple chains through IBC protocol.

## TypeScript SDK

Complete SDK simplifies integration.

Provides multiple modules including client, operator, voter, etc. Includes complete type definitions and documentation. Supports all major features: creating rounds, user registration, voting, queries, etc.
